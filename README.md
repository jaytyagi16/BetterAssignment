I chose a simple and sober design for several reasons:

1. User experience: A clean and minimalistic design helps users focus on the primary actions â€“ logging in or signing up. This simplicity reduces cognitive load and makes the process more intuitive.
2. Accessibility: A simple design ensures that the forms are accessible on various devices and browsers, making it easier for users with disabilities to interact with the app.
3. Scalability: A basic design allows for easier modifications and additions in the future, making it a scalable solution.
4. Prioritizing functionality: By keeping the design simple, I could focus on ensuring the login and signup functionality worked seamlessly, which is the primary purpose of these forms.

By choosing a simple and sober design, I aimed to create an efficient, user-friendly, and scalable solution for the login and signup process.


I have made an assumption that users will always be able to login or signup, there will not be any error. Hence, you will see the success toast only.
